### This is the markdown for our final group project proposal
## Project Title: Cooling Resources in Los Angeles County  
### Group Members: Cailyn Schmidt, Mia Yancich, Sienna Marley, Zixyuan

Our group is interested in examining which populations in Los Angeles County have access to cooling resources (i.e. tree canopy coverage and cooling centers) that would alleviate symptoms of heat stress during extreme heat days. We are interested in examining spatial patterns across social demographics such as race, age, income, and education levels in relation to access to these cooling capabilities. With the use of GIS, our project aims to visualize this data in a way that reveals which pockets in LA county need more attention and resources for extreme heat adaptation.

Rising temperatures increasingly threaten public health, especially for vulnerable groups like youth and the elderly. These groups are more vulnerable to high temperatures, which can lead to varying degrees of health complications and even death. With climate models predicting more frequent and intense heat events, proactive measures are essential. Cooling resources, such as tree canopy cover and cooling centers, are vital in reducing heat stress, yet these resources are often unevenly distributed, leaving some communities unprotected. By analyzing access to these resources alongside sociodemographic factors like race, age, income, and education, this project identifies areas in Los Angeles County most in need of attention and investment. This analysis is urgent for urban planners, as visualizing disparities in cooling resources can drive interventions that protect vulnerable populations, build climate resilience, and promote social equity in a warming world.
# Additional reasons why this project is important
*Public health (youth/ elderly affected by extreme heat)
*Climate change models continue to project hotter days
*City planners have the ability to build climate resilience
*Identify pockets that donâ€™t have resources and need attention 
*Advocate for vulnerable populations (like youth)  

# Description of spatial scope
Spatial Scope: LA County (including long beach, santa monica, other cities that may more accurately represent the access to resources)
Space/time: Data dependent but ideally within the last 10 years. As our climate continues to get hotter, it is important to have the most up to date planning infrastructure.

# A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use 
GeoMap -  LAUSD School  - 2020-21 Demographic Enrollment Information in Los Angeles Unified School District. We can use indicators such as socioeconomic disadvantaged enrollment, homeless enrollment, enrollment by race to get a comprehensive understanding of where each school is located and overlay information on location.  Data is voluntarily self-reported by local education agencies (LEAs) to the California Department of Education (CDE) and managed on the California School Directory. 
Geo Map - Tree Canopy - % of land coverage with tree canopy coverage (weighted by population size) by city within LA county. Data provided by Public Health Alliance of Southern California (PHASC) and prepared by Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (DPH) for the Community Health Profiles (CHP) Data Initiative.
GeoMap - Cooling Centers  - Data related to cooling center use during extreme heat events in LA County based on smartphone location data. Research from LA Heatwaves finds that smartphone locations can be used to reveal patterns of informal and informal cooling center use during extreme heat periods.
Possible additional data: Look into income grouped by school district in CA, Census data

# A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
Identifying patterns/distribution of low tree canopy (range) and cooling centers (points). Overlaying sociodemographic factors (SES/ race) 
Visualizations -  
## 3 charts 
  -Chart 1 - Percentage of Land With Tree Canopy Coverage (Weighted by Population Size) 
  -Chart 2 - Percentage of cooling centers (weighted by population size)
  -Chart 3 - Cities with least amount of tree canopy coverage combined with least access to cooling centers

## 2 maps

  -Map 2 - Sociodemographic characteristics overlay with canopy and cooling center locations 

# Conclusion
Through conducting this research, we expect to gain insights into the relationships between sociodemographic factors and access to cooling resources in Los Angeles County. From census tract and tree canopy information, we anticipate to see patterns between income levels, racial demographics, and the land use coverage. Our spatial analysis may reveal communities who are disproportionately affected by periods of extreme heat among vulnerable population as school children and the elderly. Additionally, we hope to explore the spatial distribution of tree canopy coverage and the distribution of cooling centers, potentially identifying areas where these resources complement or substitute for each other. In conclusion, our research seeks to identify areas with the highest need for heat mitigation interventions. Ultimately, this information can best inform policymakers and urban planners on how to improve heat silence for the most vulnerable communities across Los Angeles County.
