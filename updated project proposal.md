# Updated Group Proposal  
# Project Title: Cooling Resources in Los Angeles County    
### Group Members: Cailyn Schmidt, Mia Yancich, Sienna Marley, Zixuan Peng  
### Project Description 

Our group is interested in examining which populations in Los Angeles County have access to cooling resources (i.e. tree canopy coverage and cooling centers) that would alleviate symptoms of heat stress during extreme heat days. We are interested in examining spatial patterns across social demographics such as race, age, income, and education levels in relation to access to these cooling capabilities. With the use of GIS, our project aims to visualize this data in a way that reveals which pockets in LA county need more attention and resources for extreme heat adaptation.

Rising temperatures increasingly threaten public health, especially for vulnerable groups like youth and the elderly. These groups are more vulnerable to high temperatures, which can lead to varying degrees of health complications and even death. With climate models predicting more frequent and intense heat events, proactive measures are essential. Cooling resources, such as tree canopy cover and cooling centers, are vital in reducing heat stress, yet these resources are often unevenly distributed, leaving some communities unprotected. By analyzing access to these resources alongside sociodemographic factors like race, age, income, and education, this project identifies areas in Los Angeles County most in need of attention and investment. This analysis is urgent for urban planners, as visualizing disparities in cooling resources can drive interventions that protect vulnerable populations, build climate resilience, and promote social equity in a warming world.

#### Additional reasons why this project is important  
City planners can use this data to inform public health policy, especially for vulnerable populations such as youth or elderly, who are affected by extreme heat. As climate change models continue to project hotter days, city planners can use this data to plan for climate resilience in the communities that need it most by identifying pockets in LA county that don't have adequate resources and need additional attention.  

## Spatial scope  
Spatial Scope: LA County (including long beach, santa monica, other cities that may more accurately represent the access to resources)  
Space/time: Data dependent but ideally within the last 10 years. As our climate continues to get hotter, it is important to have the most up to date planning infrastructure.

## Conclusion  
Through conducting this research, we expect to gain insights into the relationships between sociodemographic factors and access to cooling resources in Los Angeles County. From census tract and tree canopy information, we anticipate to see patterns between income levels, racial demographics, and the land use coverage. Our spatial analysis may reveal communities who are disproportionately affected by periods of extreme heat among vulnerable population as school children and the elderly. Additionally, we hope to explore the spatial distribution of tree canopy coverage and the distribution of cooling centers, potentially identifying areas where these resources complement or substitute for each other. In conclusion, our research seeks to identify areas with the highest need for heat mitigation interventions. Ultimately, this information can best inform policymakers and urban planners on how to improve heat silence for the most vulnerable communities across Los Angeles County.
